Node.js Class: Introduction
===

This is a class put together to assist a web developer who is unfamiliar with or
new to node.js in getting started creating a web app with the express
framework, while introducing some core node concepts like `require` and `npm`.

This repo is to house the components of the class, and breaks the stages of the
workshop portion in to branches for ease of following along in a live setting.
If you are reading this on the web on your own, you may prefer a more in depth
standalone tutorial such as the official express [getting started
guide](http://expressjs.com/guide.html) or at
[hacksparrow](http://www.hacksparrow.com/express-js-tutorial.html).

You may also benefit from the [Resources
list](https://github.com/shakefon/nodejs-class-intro/blob/master/RESOURCES.md)

Getting Started
---

Clone this repository. We will begin in the app/start directory, and each step
can be caught up by switching to stepN/ folder where N is the number of the
step you are catching up to.

If you do catch up by switching directories, remember to do npm install inside
that directory before trying to run the app.
