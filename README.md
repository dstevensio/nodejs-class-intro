Node.js Class: Introduction
===

This is a class put together to assist a web developer who is unfamiliar with or
new to node.js in getting started creating a web app with the express
framework, while introducing some core node concepts like `require` and `npm`.

This repo is to house the components of the class, and breaks the stages of the
workshop portion in to branches for ease of following along in a live setting.
If you are reading this on the web on your own, you may prefer a more in depth
standalone tutorial such as the official express [getting started
guide](http://expressjs.com/guide.html) or at
[hacksparrow](http://www.hacksparrow.com/express-js-tutorial.html).

You may also benefit from the [Resources
list](https://github.com/shakefon/nodejs-class-intro/blob/master/RESOURCES.md)

Getting Started
---

Clone this repository. We will begin in the master branch, and then when
directed, switch to the next step's branch (they're named step1, step2, etc)

Before switching branches, you'll want to either stash your changes (`git
stash`) if there's something you want to keep, or do a `git reset --hard`
